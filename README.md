🧠 Parkinson's Disease Detection using Voice Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect Parkinson's Disease using voice analysis with the help of Machine Learning algorithms. The model is trained on biomedical voice measurements and predicts whether a person is likely to have Parkinson's Disease.

✨ Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering from voice datasets.

Implementation of ML algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and more.

Performance evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Visualizations of key features, correlations, and classification results.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the Parkinson's Dataset (from the UCI ML Repository). It contains biomedical voice measurements from individuals with and without Parkinson's Disease.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Modeling: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📊 Model Performance
Achieved high accuracy and balanced precision/recall for Parkinson's detection.

Evaluated models using cross-validation and confusion matrix.
